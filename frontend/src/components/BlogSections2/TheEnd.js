        Congratulations! You survived the dry sequel to my Swift Blog. Most of
        the time sequels aren&#x27;t as entertaining as the original, so this
        was expected ðŸ˜…. As you saw, most of the pre-made functions and
        properties were self explanatory. Even touchUpInside makes sense once
        you get over the name. I still have a lot to learn about iOS development
        but hopefully I taught you a few things and saved a few Food Pickers
        with this simple demo.
