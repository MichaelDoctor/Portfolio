        What is the meaning of life? Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
        Does pineapple belong on a pizza? These questions have haunted humanity
        for centuries. One of the most haunting questions is &quot;What are we
        going to eat? You decide I&#x27;m fine with anything&quot;. In this
        world, there are two types of people. Those who always have to pick what
        to eat and those who do not. Unfortunately, I am someone who always has
        to decide what we&#x27;re going to eat. In this blog, I will create a
        solution to this difficult question.

        In the last blog, I went over the Swift programming language. This time,
        we will use what we learned and create an iOS app that will save the
        food pickers of the world! ¬†This app will allow you to add, edit, and
        delete food options. With the press of a button, the app will pick one
        of the food options for you! üëèüëèüëè You can find the demo code here:
