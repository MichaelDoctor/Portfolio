        Both Java and Swift are general-purpose, compiled programming languages.
        So if you understand Java, Swift will make sense to you (hopefully)! Swift was developed by Apple and used for macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and more. In this blog, we will focus on learning how to read and write the Swift language. It's similar to learning how to do karate. We must learn how to "wax on, wax off" before winning a tournament with an illegal kick ðŸ¥‹. In my next blog, I will show you how to use Swift to create an iOS app!

        language, I can guarantee that at least you won&#x27;t fall asleep
        reading this blog. Instead, you might get hungry or cringe ðŸ˜…. Sorry,
        I&#x27;m writing this while waiting for my food, so a lot of my example
        code will be food-related.
