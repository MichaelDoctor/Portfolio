        Both Java and Swift are general-purpose, compiled programming languages.
        So if you understand Java, Swift will make sense to you (hopefully)! The
        programming language Swift is used for macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and
        more. This blog will focus on the Swift language for now.
